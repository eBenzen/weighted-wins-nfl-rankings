		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Next.js Project with Vercel Platforms Starter Kit",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js project initialization into subtasks: 1) Create Next.js app with Vercel Platforms template and verify basic setup, 2) Configure Tailwind CSS and test utility classes, 3) Set up TypeScript configuration and folder structure (/app, /components, /lib, /data), 4) Configure next.config.js for ISR and image optimization for team logos, 5) Install and configure core dependencies (recharts, environment variables)",
			"reasoning": "This is a greenfield setup task with well-defined steps. The project currently only has logos and Task Master setup files, no existing Next.js infrastructure. Complexity is moderate due to specific configuration requirements for ISR and Vercel Platforms integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Python NFL Data Calculation Engine",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide Python data engine into subtasks: 1) Set up Python environment and install nfl_data_py dependencies, 2) Implement NFL data fetching module with error handling, 3) Create weighted wins calculation logic with proper recomputation of past games, 4) Build JSON output formatter matching required schema, 5) Add week detection and validation (skip Week 1, start Week 2), 6) Implement comprehensive logging and error recovery, 7) Create unit tests with mock data for calculation verification",
			"reasoning": "Complex algorithmic task requiring external API integration, mathematical calculations with specific rules, and robust error handling. The weighted calculation logic with retrospective recomputation adds significant complexity. No existing Python infrastructure in the codebase."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Define Data Schema and JSON Storage Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split schema definition into subtasks: 1) Create TypeScript interfaces in /lib/types.ts (TeamRanking, WeekData, Game), 2) Implement data utility functions in /lib/data.ts for reading JSON files, 3) Add data validation layer using zod, 4) Set up /data directory structure and test with mock data",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward TypeScript interface creation and file I/O utilities. Lower complexity as it's mainly type definitions and basic file operations. Depends on Next.js setup but is relatively isolated."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Homepage with Rankings Table Component",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break homepage into components: 1) Create /app/page.tsx with static generation and ISR setup, 2) Build RankingsTable component with sortable columns, 3) Implement HeroSection with branding and last updated timestamp, 4) Create Footer component with about/disclaimer, 5) Add responsive Tailwind styling and team logo optimization, 6) Implement client-side sorting logic and hover states",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving multiple React components, client-side state management for sorting, responsive design, and ISR configuration. Requires integration with data schema and proper image handling for 32 team logos already in the project."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Team Detail Pages with Calculations",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize team pages development: 1) Create dynamic route /app/team/[slug]/page.tsx with slug parsing, 2) Build TeamDetail component with header and statistics display, 3) Implement WeightedScoreChart using Recharts library, 4) Add generateStaticParams for all 32 teams, 5) Create week-by-week calculation breakdown display, 6) Add SEO meta tags and navigation components",
			"reasoning": "Complex task involving dynamic routing, data visualization with Recharts, and multiple display components. Requires careful integration with data structure and handling of all 32 teams. Chart implementation and responsive design add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up GitHub Actions for Automated Data Updates",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure GitHub Actions workflow: 1) Create workflow file with cron schedules for NFL game days, 2) Configure Python environment and dependency caching, 3) Set up script execution and JSON file generation, 4) Implement git commit automation with proper authentication, 5) Add error handling, notifications, and manual trigger option",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving CI/CD configuration, scheduled automation, and git operations. Requires careful handling of secrets and error cases. The multi-schedule cron setup and integration with Python script adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Vercel Deployment with ISR",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split Vercel setup into steps: 1) Create vercel.json with build and ISR configuration, 2) Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard, 3) Set up ISR revalidation and caching strategies, 4) Configure custom domain and redirects if applicable, 5) Add security headers and monitor Hobby tier limits",
			"reasoning": "Standard deployment configuration with specific requirements for ISR and Hobby tier optimization. Complexity is moderate due to performance optimization needs and proper caching setup."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Fallback States",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize error handling implementation: 1) Create global error boundary in /app/error.tsx, 2) Build component-level ErrorBoundary wrapper, 3) Add loading.tsx files with skeleton UI for each route, 4) Implement fallback states (empty, error, loading), 5) Add try-catch blocks to all data operations, 6) Handle edge cases (missing logos, malformed JSON, network issues)",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling across the application requires touching multiple components and routes. Complexity comes from creating consistent fallback UI and handling various failure scenarios gracefully."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Documentation and Setup Instructions",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure documentation tasks: 1) Write comprehensive README.md with setup and deployment guides, 2) Document Python script methodology and JSON schema, 3) Create troubleshooting guide and architecture diagrams",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity documentation task that consolidates information about the implemented system. Straightforward writing task with clear requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add Testing Suite and Quality Assurance",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize testing implementation: 1) Set up Jest and React Testing Library configuration, 2) Write unit tests for sorting and data utilities, 3) Create component tests for RankingsTable and TeamDetail, 4) Set up Python pytest for calculation engine testing, 5) Implement E2E tests with Playwright, 6) Configure pre-commit hooks for linting, 7) Add GitHub Actions CI pipeline for automated testing",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple testing frameworks (Jest, pytest, Playwright), different test types (unit, integration, E2E), and CI/CD integration. Requires comprehensive coverage across both Python and JavaScript codebases."
