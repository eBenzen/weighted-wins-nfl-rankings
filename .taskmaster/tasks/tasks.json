Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard: NODE_ENV=production, any API keys needed. Set up build command: 'npm run build'. Configure ISR in Next.js: revalidate period of 3600 seconds for homepage, on-demand revalidation webhook for GitHub Actions. Optimize for Hobby tier limits: minimize serverless function usage, use static generation wherever possible, implement proper caching headers. Set up custom domain if available. Configure redirects for www to non-www. Add security headers for production. Monitor build times and optimize if needed.",

Implement graceful degradation: Show cached data if fresh data fails, Display previous week's data as fallback, Show informative error messages. Add client-side error logging (console or service).
