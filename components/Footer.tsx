            </h3>

              WeightedWins provides an alternative NFL ranking system that factors in the strength
              of opponents. Teams earn weighted wins based on their opponents' win totals, and
              weighted losses based on opponents' loss totals. This creates a more nuanced view
              of team performance beyond simple win-loss records.
